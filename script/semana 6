## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
data<- read_csv("C:/Users/WINDOWS 2024/Downloads/s02_treat_artritis.csv")

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
data_limpia<-data(!is.na(data$CDAI),)

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
